# Heart Disease Predictive Analysis
Heart Diseases can be caused by different kind of factors such as genetics, lifestyle, medical conditions, environmental factors etc. Early diagnosis is crucial for carrying out a successful treatment, therefore we decided to perform an analysis to understand which are the most influential biometrics that define the condition, focusing on a binary classification task which uses parameters that can be obtained simply by performing clinical tests. The dataset we used for our task was created by combining different available datasets over common features. It contains 918 patient records described by 11 variables plus a binary target for the diagnosis.

## Project Outline
1. ***Data Preprocessing:*** Dealing with categorical variables and NA values.
2. ***Data Exploration:*** Performing EDA consisting of univariate, bivariate, and correlation anlaysis.
3. ***Data Modeling:*** Testing different statisical models on the data, such as: Logistic, Ridge, Lasso regression, LDA, and QDA.
4. ***Data Interpretation:*** Explaining the best model and making further considerations on the behavior of a specific variable.
5. ***Conclusions:*** Discussing the results and suggesting potential applications.
